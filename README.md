# Pylox Interpreter
An implementation of a tree walker interpreter for the Lox language from the book Crafting Interpreters by Bob Nystrom in Python.
The interpreter can be used in two different ways, with REPL by just running src/lox.py or to run a file by passing a path to the file and incapsulate it in quotation marks.

# Progress
Finished challenges of chapter 1-7 & starting chapter 8.
